title: Hello, world!

I did it! My first steps with new platform and legendary worlds every programmer is happy to see. Hello, world! And hello to you!

Welcome to my [Blog](http://juraj.blahunka.eu/), a place, where I will discuss my thoughts on software development. I hope, that I will achieve at least some of following goals:

* Contribute to the Open Source community, so expect musings about personal projects ([GitHub](https://github.com/juraj-blahunka)).
* Remind myself about stuff I tend to forget, so expect mental notes about small pieces of technology.
* Create content, which is easy to read, understand and process, so expect a lot of:

``` java
try {
	writeContent();
} catch (NoPointInPublishingException e) {
	tryAgain();
}
```

My name is Juraj Blahunka and I'm Java+.
